## Business Question
Retail businesses generate large volumes of sales data, but raw data does not translate into decisions.  
The core business problem is the **lack of clear visibility into sales performance, profitability, customer segments, and regional trends**.

This project answers the key business question:  
**How is the Superstore performing across products, customers, regions, and time—and where should management focus to improve profitability?**

---

## Why This Analysis Is Needed
The Superstore operates across multiple regions, product categories, customer segments, and shipping modes. Each dimension impacts revenue, cost, and profit differently.

This dashboard is built to:
- Provide a centralized performance view
- Identify high- and low-performing areas
- Track sales and profit trends over time
- Support data-driven strategic and operational decisions

The objective is **actionable insights**, not static reporting.

- Order and shipment details
- Sales, quantity, and profit metrics
